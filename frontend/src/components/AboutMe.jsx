            I am a Full Stack Developer based in Lagos with a background in

            I specialize in building scalable, accessible, and user-friendly
            solutions using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>Next.js</strong>.
            With a strong foundation in both <strong>Front end</strong> and
            <strong> Back end</strong> development, I aim to create products
            that are not only functional but also deliver seamless user
            experiences. Passionate about problem-solving and continuous
            learning, Iâ€™m currently deepening my knowledge of design principles
            to strengthen my ability to bridge development and design. Outside
            of coding, I enjoy football, chess, reading, and playing the drums.
